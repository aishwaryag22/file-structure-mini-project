Implementation of Btree
Abstract : A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. The B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children. Unlike self â€“balancing binary search tree the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as discs. It is commonly used in databases and file systems. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation.
The term B-tree may refer to a specific design or it may refer to a general class of designs. In the narrow sense, a B-tree stores keys in its internal nodes but need not store those keys in the records at the leaves. The  general  class  includes  variations  such  as  the B+  tree HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree" and  the B* tree.
Implementation of B-tree for Photography Record, id is considered as the primary key.The B-tree has been constructed for one lakh records by considering the primary key.Basically we are implementing the operations of B-tree such as insertion and search.Generation of B-tree and display of B-tree is also been implemented as part of the mini project.Time analysis is also computed for insertion,search and generation of B-tree.A time analysis graph has been plot for generation of a B-tree by considering time taken for generation of B-tree for every  ten thousands of records.
